# SCUM-Stength-Leveler
SCUM strength levelling applet using a bicycle.

## How it works:
Uses the middle mouse button (scrollwheel press) to continually press D+W keys. Now with two modes: Normal and Calibrated.

## Things you will need:
- Flat surface to ride the bicycle on (3x3 foundations work well)
- Flower, sugar, water, (lots) of coffee
- Items to make yourself heavy (crafted sand bags are 4x4 & 20kg each)

## Instructions:

### Normal Mode:
1. Run the executable and select option 1
2. Alt-TAB to the game and mount a bicycle
3. Press the middle mouse button to toggle ON/OFF
4. Check on your character periodically to ensure you haven't passed out
5. When stopped, the duration will be displayed (useful for Calibtated mode timing)

### Calibrated Mode:
1. First use Normal mode to determine your optimal timings:
   - Cycle until your character is about to pass out, note the time and round down to the nearest 5 or 10
   - Close the app & time how long it takes to fully regain stamina
2. Run the app again and select option 2
3. Enter both times in minutes (whole numbers):
   - Cycling time until exhaustion (e.g: 30)
   - Resting time for full stamina recovery (e.g: 2)
4. Press middle mouse button to start/stop automatically alternating between cycling and resting periods

## Notes:
- Times should be entered as whole numbers in minutes
- Use Ctrl+C in the terminal to force exit or simply use the close button
